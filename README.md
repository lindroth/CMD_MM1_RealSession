CMD_MM1_RealSession
===================

__If this script does not work for you, it might me that your CMD-MM1 does not send on MIDI channel 1__
__In the file MM1.py change CHANNEL = 0 to CHANNEL = 4__

You can easily check which channel your CMD MM1 sends on in live by mapping a knob on the MM-1 to something and then check the channel in the midi mappings window in Live.

This is a Ableton Live 9 and 10 Remote Script for the Behringer CMD MM1 that moves the faders and knobs with the moving session box in live.
Knobs is assigned to the first device for each track by spit, magic and gnomes.

So why is that awesome you ask? Just drop in an Audio Effect Rack or a Instrument Rack first in the chain on a channel and map the macros to whatever you want in the chain.
The knobs on the CMD-MM1 will now map to this device by magic for each channel. Works with other devices too, but I find having an Audio Effect Rack or a Instrument Rack when playing live
gives me bigger freedom with the mapping.

A big thanks too Behringer for releasing the CMD MM-1 and for releasing their remote scripts.
